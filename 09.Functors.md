# Functors

In the last section we've spoken about the _TS_ category (the TypeScript category) and about function composition's core problem:

> How can we compose two generic functions `f: (a: A) => B` and `g: (c: C) => D`?

Why is finding solutions to this problem so important?

Because, if it is true that categories can be used to model programming languages, morphisms (functions in the _TS_ category) can be used to model **programs**.

Thus, solving this abstract problem means finding a concrete way of **composing programs in a generic way**. And _that_ is really interesting for us developers, isn't it?

## Functions as programs

If we want to model programs with functions we need to tackle an issue immediately:

> How is it possible to model a program that produces side effects with a pure function?

The answer is to model side effects through **effects**, meaning types that **represent** side effects.

Let's see two possible techniques to do so in JavaScript:

- define a DSL (domain specific language) for effects
- use a _thunk_

The first technique, using a DSL, means modifying a program like:

```ts
function log(message: string): void {
  console.log(message) // side effect
}
```

changing its codomain to make the function return a **description** of the side effect:

```ts
type DSL = ... // sum type of every possible effect handled by the system

function log(message: string): DSL {
  return {
    type: "log",
    message
  }
}
```

**Quiz**. Is the freshly defined `log` function really pure? Actually `log('foo') !== log('foo')`!

This technique requires a way to combine effects and the definition of an interpreter able to execute the side effects when launching the final program.

The second technique, way simpler in TypeScript, is to enclose the computation in a _thunk_:

```ts
// a thunk representing a synchronous side effect
type IO<A> = () => A

const log = (message: string): IO<void> => {
  return () => console.log(message) // returns a thunk
}
```

The `log` program, once executed, won't cause immediately a side effect, but returns **a value representing the computation** (also known as _action_).

```ts
import { IO } from 'fp-ts/IO'

export const log = (message: string): IO<void> => {
  return () => console.log(message) // returns a thunk
}

export const main = log('hello!')
// there's nothing in the output at this point
// because `main` is only an inert value
// representing the computation

main()
// only when launching the program I will see the result
```

In functional programming there's a tendency to shove side effects (under the form of effects) to the border of the system (the `main` function) where they are executed by an interpreter obtaining the following schema:

> system = pure core + imperative shell

In _purely functional_ languages (like Haskell, PureScript or Elm) this division is strict and clear and imposed by the very languages.

Even with this thunk technique (the same technique used in `fp-ts`) we need a way to combine effects, which brings us back to our goal of composing programs in a generic way, let's see how.

We first need a bit of (informal) terminology: we'll call **pure program** a function with the following signature:

```ts
(a: A) => B
```

Such a signature models a program that takes an input of type `A` and returns a result of type `B` without any effect.

**Example**

The `len` program:

```ts
const len = (s: string): number => s.length
```

We'll call an **effectful program** a function with the following signature:

```ts
(a: A) => F<B>
```

Such a signature models a program that takes an input of type `A` and returns a result of type `B` together with an **effect** `F`, where `F` is some sort of type constructor.

Let's recall that a [type constructor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_constructor) is an `n`-ary type operator that takes as argument one or more types and returns another type. We have seen examples of such constructors as `Option`, `ReadonlyArray`, `Either`.

**Example**

The `head` program:

```ts
import { Option, some, none } from 'fp-ts/Option'

const head = <A>(as: ReadonlyArray<A>): Option<A> =>
  as.length === 0 ? none : some(as[0])
```

is a program with an `Option` effect.

When we talk about effects we are interested in `n`-ary type constructors where `n >= 1`, example given:

| Type constructor   | Effect (interpretation)                        |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `ReadonlyArray<A>` | a non deterministic computation                |
| `Option<A>`        | a computation that may fail                    |
| `Either<E, A>`     | a computation that may fail                    |
| `IO<A>`            | a synchronous computation that **never fails** |
| `Task<A>`          | an asynchronous computation **never fails**    |
| `Reader<R, A>`     | reading from an environment                    |

where

```ts
// a thunk returning a `Promise`
type Task<A> = () => Promise<A>
```

```ts
// `R` represents an "environment" needed for the computation
// (we can "read" from it) and `A` is the result
type Reader<R, A> = (r: R) => A
```

Let's get back to our core problem:

> How do we compose two generic functions `f: (a: A) => B` e `g: (c: C) => D`?

With our current set of rules this general problem is not solvable. We need to add some _boundaries_ to `B` and `C`.

We already know that if `B = C` then the solution is the usual function composition.

```ts
function flow<A, B, C>(f: (a: A) => B, g: (b: B) => C): (a: A) => C {
  return (a) => g(f(a))
}
```

But what about other cases?

## A boundary that leads to functors

Let's consider the following boundary: `B = F<C>` for some type constructor `F`, we have the following situation:

- `f: (a: A) => F<B>` is an effectful program
- `g: (b: B) => C` is a pure program

In order to compose `f` with `g` we need to find a procedure that allows us to derive a function `g` from a function `(b: B) => C` to a function `(fb: F<B>) => F<C>` in order to use the usual function composition (this way the codomain of `f` would be the same of the new function's domain).

<img src="images/map.png" width="500" alt="map" />

We have mutated the original problem in a new one: can we find a function, let's call it `map`, that operates this way?

Let's see some practical example:

**Example** (`F = ReadonlyArray`)

```ts
import { flow, pipe } from 'fp-ts/function'

// transforms functions `B -> C` to functions `ReadonlyArray<B> -> ReadonlyArray<C>`
const map = <B, C>(g: (b: B) => C) => (
  fb: ReadonlyArray<B>
): ReadonlyArray<C> => fb.map(g)

// -------------------
// usage example
// -------------------

interface User {
  readonly id: number
  readonly name: string
  readonly followers: ReadonlyArray<User>
}

const getFollowers = (user: User): ReadonlyArray<User> => user.followers
const getName = (user: User): string => user.name

// getFollowersNames: User -> ReadonlyArray<string>
const getFollowersNames = flow(getFollowers, map(getName))

// let's use `pipe` instead of `flow`...
export const getFollowersNames2 = (user: User) =>
  pipe(user, getFollowers, map(getName))

const user: User = {
  id: 1,
  name: 'Ruth R. Gonzalez',
  followers: [
    { id: 2, name: 'Terry R. Emerson', followers: [] },
    { id: 3, name: 'Marsha J. Joslyn', followers: [] }
  ]
}

console.log(getFollowersNames(user)) // => [ 'Terry R. Emerson', 'Marsha J. Joslyn' ]
```

**Example** (`F = Option`)

```ts
import { flow } from 'fp-ts/function'
import { none, Option, match, some } from 'fp-ts/Option'

// transforms functions `B -> C` to functions `Option<B> -> Option<C>`
const map = <B, C>(g: (b: B) => C): ((fb: Option<B>) => Option<C>) =>
  match(
    () => none,
    (b) => {
      const c = g(b)
      return some(c)
    }
  )

// -------------------
// usage example
// -------------------

import * as RA from 'fp-ts/ReadonlyArray'

const head: (input: ReadonlyArray<number>) => Option<number> = RA.head
const double = (n: number): number => n * 2

// getDoubleHead: ReadonlyArray<number> -> Option<number>
const getDoubleHead = flow(head, map(double))

console.log(getDoubleHead([1, 2, 3])) // => some(2)
console.log(getDoubleHead([])) // => none
```

**Example** (`F = IO`)

```ts
import { flow } from 'fp-ts/function'
import { IO } from 'fp-ts/IO'

// transforms functions `B -> C` to functions `IO<B> -> IO<C>`
const map = <B, C>(g: (b: B) => C) => (fb: IO<B>): IO<C> => () => {
  const b = fb()
  return g(b)
}

// -------------------
// usage example
// -------------------

interface User {
  readonly id: number
  readonly name: string
}

// a dummy in-memory database
const database: Record<number, User> = {
  1: { id: 1, name: 'Ruth R. Gonzalez' },
  2: { id: 2, name: 'Terry R. Emerson' },
  3: { id: 3, name: 'Marsha J. Joslyn' }
}

const getUser = (id: number): IO<User> => () => database[id]
const getName = (user: User): string => user.name

// getUserName: number -> IO<string>
const getUserName = flow(getUser, map(getName))

console.log(getUserName(1)()) // => Ruth R. Gonzalez
```

**Example** (`F = Task`)

```ts
import { flow } from 'fp-ts/function'
import { Task } from 'fp-ts/Task'

// transforms functions `B -> C` into functions `Task<B> -> Task<C>`
const map = <B, C>(g: (b: B) => C) => (fb: Task<B>): Task<C> => () => {
  const promise = fb()
  return promise.then(g)
}

// -------------------
// usage example
// -------------------

interface User {
  readonly id: number
  readonly name: string
}

// a dummy remote database
const database: Record<number, User> = {
  1: { id: 1, name: 'Ruth R. Gonzalez' },
  2: { id: 2, name: 'Terry R. Emerson' },
  3: { id: 3, name: 'Marsha J. Joslyn' }
}

const getUser = (id: number): Task<User> => () => Promise.resolve(database[id])
const getName = (user: User): string => user.name

// getUserName: number -> Task<string>
const getUserName = flow(getUser, map(getName))

getUserName(1)().then(console.log) // => Ruth R. Gonzalez
```

**Example** (`F = Reader`)

```ts
import { flow } from 'fp-ts/function'
import { Reader } from 'fp-ts/Reader'

// transforms functions `B -> C` into functions `Reader<R, B> -> Reader<R, C>`
const map = <B, C>(g: (b: B) => C) => <R>(fb: Reader<R, B>): Reader<R, C> => (
  r
) => {
  const b = fb(r)
  return g(b)
}

// -------------------
// usage example
// -------------------

interface User {
  readonly id: number
  readonly name: string
}

interface Env {
  // a dummy in-memory database
  readonly database: Record<string, User>
}

const getUser = (id: number): Reader<Env, User> => (env) => env.database[id]
const getName = (user: User): string => user.name

// getUserName: number -> Reader<Env, string>
const getUserName = flow(getUser, map(getName))

console.log(
  getUserName(1)({
    database: {
      1: { id: 1, name: 'Ruth R. Gonzalez' },
      2: { id: 2, name: 'Terry R. Emerson' },
      3: { id: 3, name: 'Marsha J. Joslyn' }
    }
  })
) // => Ruth R. Gonzalez
```

More generally, when a type constructor `F` admits a `map` function, we say it admits a **functor instance**.

From a mathematical point of view, functors are **maps between categories** that preserve the structure of the category, meaning they preserve the identity morphisms and the composition operation.

Since categories are pairs of objects and morphisms, a functor too is a pair of two things:

- a **map between objects** that binds every object `X` in _C_ to an object in _D_.
- a **map between morphisms** that binds every morphism `f` in _C_ to a morphism `map(f)` in _D_.

where _C_ e _D_ are two categories (aka two programming languages).

<img src="images/functor.png" width="500" alt="functor" />

Even though a map between two different programming languages is a fascinating idea, we're more interested in a map where _C_ and _D_ are the same (the _TS_ category). In that case we're talking about **endofunctors** (from the greek "endo" meaning "inside", "internal").

From now on, unless specified differently, when we write "functor" we mean an endofunctor in the _TS_ category.

Now we know the practical side of functors, let's see the formal definition.

## Definition

A functor is a pair `(F, map)` where:

- `F` is an `n`-ary (`n >= 1`) type constructor mapping every type `X` in a type `F<X>` (**map between objects**)
- `map` is a function with the following signature:

```ts
map: <A, B>(f: (a: A) => B) => ((fa: F<A>) => F<B>)
```

that maps every function `f: (a: A) => B` in a function `map(f): (fa: F<A>) => F<B>` (**map between morphism**)

The following properties have to hold true:

- `map(1`<sub>X</sub>`)` = `1`<sub>F(X)</sub> (**identities go to identities**)
- `map(g ∘ f) = map(g) ∘ map(f)` (**the image of a composition is the composition of its images**)

The second law allows to refactor and optimize the following computation:

```ts
import { flow, increment, pipe } from 'fp-ts/function'
import { map } from 'fp-ts/ReadonlyArray'

const double = (n: number): number => n * 2

// iterates array twice
console.log(pipe([1, 2, 3], map(double), map(increment))) // => [ 3, 5, 7 ]

// single iteration
console.log(pipe([1, 2, 3], map(flow(double, increment)))) // => [ 3, 5, 7 ]
```

## Functors and functional error handling

Functors have a positive impact on functional error handling, let's see a practical example:

```ts
declare const doSomethingWithIndex: (index: number) => string

export const program = (ns: ReadonlyArray<number>): string => {
  // -1 indicates that no element has been found
  const i = ns.findIndex((n) => n > 0)
  if (i !== -1) {
    return doSomethingWithIndex(i)
  }
  throw new Error('cannot find a positive number')
}
```

Using the native `findIndex` API we are forced to use an `if` branch to test whether we have a result different than `-1`. If we forget to do so, the value `-1` could be unintentionally passed as input to `doSomethingWithIndex`.

Let's see how easier it is to obtain the same behavior using `Option` and its functor instance:

```ts
import { pipe } from 'fp-ts/function'
import { map, Option } from 'fp-ts/Option'
import { findIndex } from 'fp-ts/ReadonlyArray'

declare const doSomethingWithIndex: (index: number) => string

export const program = (ns: ReadonlyArray<number>): Option<string> =>
  pipe(
    ns,
    findIndex((n) => n > 0),
    map(doSomethingWithIndex)
  )
```

Practically, using `Option`, we're always in front of the `happy path`, error handing happens behind the scenes thanks to `map`.

**Demo** (optional)

[`04_functor.ts`](src/04_functor.ts)

**Quiz**. `Task<A>` represents an asynchronous call that always succeed, how can we model a computation that can fail instead?

## Functors compose

Functors compose, meaning that given two functors `F` and `G` then the composition `F<G<A>>` is still a functor and the `map` of this composition is the composition of the `map`s.

**Example** (`F = Task`, `G = Option`)

```ts
import { flow } from 'fp-ts/function'
import * as O from 'fp-ts/Option'
import * as T from 'fp-ts/Task'

type TaskOption<A> = T.Task<O.Option<A>>

export const map: <A, B>(
  f: (a: A) => B
) => (fa: TaskOption<A>) => TaskOption<B> = flow(O.map, T.map)

// -------------------
// usage example
// -------------------

interface User {
  readonly id: number
  readonly name: string
}

// a dummy remote database
const database: Record<number, User> = {
  1: { id: 1, name: 'Ruth R. Gonzalez' },
  2: { id: 2, name: 'Terry R. Emerson' },
  3: { id: 3, name: 'Marsha J. Joslyn' }
}

const getUser = (id: number): TaskOption<User> => () =>
  Promise.resolve(O.fromNullable(database[id]))
const getName = (user: User): string => user.name

// getUserName: number -> TaskOption<string>
const getUserName = flow(getUser, map(getName))

getUserName(1)().then(console.log) // => some('Ruth R. Gonzalez')
getUserName(4)().then(console.log) // => none
```

## Contravariant Functors

In the previous section we haven't been completely thorough with our definitions. What we have seen in the previous section and called "functors" should be more properly called **covariant functors**.

In this section we'll see another variant of the functor concept, **contravariant** functors.

The definition of a contravariant functor is pretty much the same of the covariant one, except for the signature of its fundamental operation, which is called `contramap` rather than `map`.

<img src="images/contramap.png" width="300" alt="contramap" />

**Example**

```ts
import { map } from 'fp-ts/Option'
import { contramap } from 'fp-ts/Eq'

type User = {
  readonly id: number
  readonly name: string
}

const getId = (_: User): number => _.id

// the way `map` operates...
// const getIdOption: (fa: Option<User>) => Option<number>
const getIdOption = map(getId)

// the way `contramap` operates...
// const getIdEq: (fa: Eq<number>) => Eq<User>
const getIdEq = contramap(getId)

import * as N from 'fp-ts/number'

const EqID = getIdEq(N.Eq)

/*

In the `Eq` chapter we saw:

const EqID: Eq<User> = pipe(
  N.Eq,
  contramap((_: User) => _.id)
)
*/
```

## Functors in `fp-ts`

How do we define a functor instance in `fp-ts`? Let's see some example.

The following interface represents the model of some result we get by calling some HTTP API:

```ts
interface Response<A> {
  url: string
  status: number
  headers: Record<string, string>
  body: A
}
```

Please note that since `body` is parametric, this makes `Response` a good candidate to find a functor instance given that `Response` is a an `n`-ary type constructor with `n >= 1` (a necessary condition).

To define a functor instance for `Response` we need to define a `map` function along some [technical details](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/recipes/HKT.html) required by `fp-ts`.

```ts
// `Response.ts` module

import { pipe } from 'fp-ts/function'
import { Functor1 } from 'fp-ts/Functor'

declare module 'fp-ts/HKT' {
  interface URItoKind<A> {
    readonly Response: Response<A>
  }
}

export interface Response<A> {
  readonly url: string
  readonly status: number
  readonly headers: Record<string, string>
  readonly body: A
}

export const map = <A, B>(f: (a: A) => B) => (
  fa: Response<A>
): Response<B> => ({
  ...fa,
  body: f(fa.body)
})

// functor instance for `Response<A>`
export const Functor: Functor1<'Response'> = {
  URI: 'Response',
  map: (fa, f) => pipe(fa, map(f))
}
```

## Do functors solve the general problem?

Not yet. Functors allow us to compose an effectful program `f` with a pure program `g`, but `g` has to be a **unary** function, accepting one single argument. What happens if `g` takes two or more arguments?

| Program f | Program g               | Composition  |
| --------- | ----------------------- | ------------ |
| pure      | pure                    | `g ∘ f`      |
| effectful | pure (unary)            | `map(g) ∘ f` |
| effectful | pure (`n`-ary, `n > 1`) | ?            |

To manage this circumstance we need something _more_, in the next chapter we'll see another important abstraction in functional programming: **applicative functors**.

# Applicative functors

In the section regarding functors we've seen that we can compose an effectful program `f: (a: A) => F<B>` with a pure one `g: (b: B) => C` through the transformation of `g` to a function `map(g): (fb: F<B>) => F<C>` (if and only if `F` admits a functor instance).

| Program f | Program g    | Composition  |
| --------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| pure      | pure         | `g ∘ f`      |
| effectful | pure (unary) | `map(g) ∘ f` |

But `g` has to be unary, it can only accept a single argument as input. What happens if `g` accepts two arguments? Can we still transform `g` using only the functor instance?

## Currying

First of all we need to model a function that accepts two arguments of type `B` and `C` (we can use a tuple for this) and returns a value of type `D`:

```ts
g: (b: B, c: C) => D
```

We can rewrite `g` using a technique called **currying**.

> Currying is the technique of translating the evaluation of a function that takes multiple arguments into evaluating a sequence of functions, **each with a single argument**. For example, a function that takes two arguments, one from `B` and one from `C`, and produces outputs in `D`, by currying is translated into a function that takes a single argument from `C` and produces as outputs functions from `B` to `C`.

(source: [currying on wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying))

Thus, through currying, we can rewrite `g` as:

```ts
g: (b: B) => (c: C) => D
```

**Example**

```ts
interface User {
  readonly id: number
  readonly name: string
  readonly followers: ReadonlyArray<User>
}

const addFollower = (follower: User, user: User): User => ({
  ...user,
  followers: [...user.followers, follower]
})
```

Let's refactor `addFollower` through currying

```ts
interface User {
  readonly id: number
  readonly name: string
  readonly followers: ReadonlyArray<User>
}

const addFollower = (follower: User) => (user: User): User => ({
  ...user,
  followers: [...user.followers, follower]
})

// -------------------
// usage example
// -------------------

const user: User = { id: 1, name: 'Ruth R. Gonzalez', followers: [] }
const follower: User = { id: 3, name: 'Marsha J. Joslyn', followers: [] }

console.log(addFollower(follower)(user))
/*
{
  id: 1,
  name: 'Ruth R. Gonzalez',
  followers: [ { id: 3, name: 'Marsha J. Joslyn', followers: [] } ]
}
*/
```

## The `ap` operation

Suppose that:

- we do not have a `follower` but only his `id`
- we do not have a `user` but only his `id`
- that we have an API `fetchUser` which, given an `id`, queries an endpoint that returns the corresponding `User`

```ts
import * as T from 'fp-ts/Task'

interface User {
  readonly id: number
  readonly name: string
  readonly followers: ReadonlyArray<User>
}

const addFollower = (follower: User) => (user: User): User => ({
  ...user,
  followers: [...user.followers, follower]
})

declare const fetchUser: (id: number) => T.Task<User>

const userId = 1
const followerId = 3

const result = addFollower(fetchUser(followerId))(fetchUser(userId)) // does not compile
```

I can't use `addFollower` anymore! How can we proceed?

If only we had a function with the following signature:

```ts
declare const addFollowerAsync: (
  follower: T.Task<User>
) => (user: T.Task<User>) => T.Task<User>
```

we could proceed with ease:

```ts
import * as T from 'fp-ts/Task'

interface User {
  readonly id: number
  readonly name: string
  readonly followers: ReadonlyArray<User>
}

declare const fetchUser: (id: number) => T.Task<User>

declare const addFollowerAsync: (
  follower: T.Task<User>
) => (user: T.Task<User>) => T.Task<User>

const userId = 1
const followerId = 3

// const result: T.Task<User>
const result = addFollowerAsync(fetchUser(followerId))(fetchUser(userId)) // now compiles
```

We can obviously implement `addFollowerAsync` manually, but is it possible instead to find a transformation which starting with a function like `addFollower: (follower: User) => (user: User): User` returns a function like `addFollowerAsync: (follower: Task<User>) => (user: Task<User>) => Task<User>`?

More generally what we would like to have is a transformation, call it `liftA2`, which beginning with a function `g: (b: B) => (c: C) => D` returns a function with the following signature:

```ts
liftA2(g): (fb: F<B>) => (fc: F<C>) => F<D>
```

<img src="images/liftA2.png" width="500" alt="liftA2" />

How can we obtain it? Given that `g` is now a unary function, we can leverage the functor instance and the good old `map`:

```ts
map(g): (fb: F<B>) => F<(c: C) => D>
```

<img src="images/liftA2-first-step.png" width="500" alt="liftA2 (first step)" />

Now we are blocked: there's no legal operation the functor instance provides us to "unpack" the type `F<(c: C) => D>` into `(fc: F<C>) => F<D>`.

We need to introduce a new operation `ap` which realizes this unpacking:

```ts
declare const ap: <A>(fa: Task<A>) => <B>(fab: Task<(a: A) => B>) => Task<B>
```

**Note**. Why is it names "ap"? Because it can be seen like some sort of function application.

```ts
// `apply` applies a function to a value
declare const apply: <A>(a: A) => <B>(f: (a: A) => B) => B

declare const ap: <A>(a: Task<A>) => <B>(f: Task<(a: A) => B>) => Task<B>
// `ap` applies a function wrapped into an effect to a value wrapped into an effect
```

Now that we have `ap` we can define `liftA2`:

```ts
import { pipe } from 'fp-ts/function'
import * as T from 'fp-ts/Task'

const liftA2 = <B, C, D>(g: (b: B) => (c: C) => D) => (fb: T.Task<B>) => (
  fc: T.Task<C>
): T.Task<D> => pipe(fb, T.map(g), T.ap(fc))

interface User {
  readonly id: number
  readonly name: string
  readonly followers: ReadonlyArray<User>
}

const addFollower = (follower: User) => (user: User): User => ({
  ...user,
  followers: [...user.followers, follower]
})

// const addFollowerAsync: (fb: T.Task<User>) => (fc: T.Task<User>) => T.Task<User>
const addFollowerAsync = liftA2(addFollower)
```

and finally, we can compose `fetchUser` with the previous result:

```ts
import { flow, pipe } from 'fp-ts/function'
import * as T from 'fp-ts/Task'

const liftA2 = <B, C, D>(g: (b: B) => (c: C) => D) => (fb: T.Task<B>) => (
  fc: T.Task<C>
): T.Task<D> => pipe(fb, T.map(g), T.ap(fc))

interface User {
  readonly id: number
  readonly name: string
  readonly followers: ReadonlyArray<User>
}

const addFollower = (follower: User) => (user: User): User => ({
  ...user,
  followers: [...user.followers, follower]
})

declare const fetchUser: (id: number) => T.Task<User>

// const program: (id: number) => (fc: T.Task<User>) => T.Task<User>
const program = flow(fetchUser, liftA2(addFollower))

const userId = 1
const followerId = 3

// const result: T.Task<User>
const result = program(followerId)(fetchUser(userId))
```

We have found a standard procedure to compose two functions `f: (a: A) => F<B>`, `g: (b: B, c: C) => D`:

1. we transform `g` through currying in a function `g: (b: B) => (c: C) => D`
2. we define the `ap` function for the effect `F` (library function)
3. we define the utility function `liftA2` for the effect `F` (library function)
4. we obtain the composition `flow(f, liftA2(g))`

Let's see how's the `ap` operation implemented for some of the type constructors we've already seen:

**Example** (`F = ReadonlyArray`)

```ts
import { increment, pipe } from 'fp-ts/function'

const ap = <A>(fa: ReadonlyArray<A>) => <B>(
  fab: ReadonlyArray<(a: A) => B>
): ReadonlyArray<B> => {
  const out: Array<B> = []
  for (const f of fab) {
    for (const a of fa) {
      out.push(f(a))
    }
  }
  return out
}

const double = (n: number): number => n * 2

pipe([double, increment], ap([1, 2, 3]), console.log) // => [ 2, 4, 6, 2, 3, 4 ]
```

**Example** (`F = Option`)

```ts
import { pipe } from 'fp-ts/function'
import * as O from 'fp-ts/Option'

const ap = <A>(fa: O.Option<A>) => <B>(
  fab: O.Option<(a: A) => B>
): O.Option<B> =>
  pipe(
    fab,
    O.match(
      () => O.none,
      (f) =>
        pipe(
          fa,
          O.match(
            () => O.none,
            (a) => O.some(f(a))
          )
        )
    )
  )

const double = (n: number): number => n * 2

pipe(O.some(double), ap(O.some(1)), console.log) // => some(2)
pipe(O.some(double), ap(O.none), console.log) // => none
pipe(O.none, ap(O.some(1)), console.log) // => none
pipe(O.none, ap(O.none), console.log) // => none
```

**Example** (`F = IO`)

```ts
import { IO } from 'fp-ts/IO'

const ap = <A>(fa: IO<A>) => <B>(fab: IO<(a: A) => B>): IO<B> => () => {
  const f = fab()
  const a = fa()
  return f(a)
}
```

**Example** (`F = Task`)

```ts
import { Task } from 'fp-ts/Task'

const ap = <A>(fa: Task<A>) => <B>(fab: Task<(a: A) => B>): Task<B> => () =>
  Promise.all([fab(), fa()]).then(([f, a]) => f(a))
```

**Example** (`F = Reader`)

```ts
import { Reader } from 'fp-ts/Reader'

const ap = <R, A>(fa: Reader<R, A>) => <B>(
  fab: Reader<R, (a: A) => B>
): Reader<R, B> => (r) => {
  const f = fab(r)
  const a = fa(r)
  return f(a)
}
```

We've seen how with `ap` we can manage functions with two parameters, but what happens with functions that take **three** parameters? Do we need _yet another abstraction_?

Good news is no, `map` and `ap` are sufficient:

```ts
import { pipe } from 'fp-ts/function'
import * as T from 'fp-ts/Task'

const liftA3 = <B, C, D, E>(f: (b: B) => (c: C) => (d: D) => E) => (
  fb: T.Task<B>
) => (fc: T.Task<C>) => (fd: T.Task<D>): T.Task<E> =>
  pipe(fb, T.map(f), T.ap(fc), T.ap(fd))

const liftA4 = <B, C, D, E, F>(
  f: (b: B) => (c: C) => (d: D) => (e: E) => F
) => (fb: T.Task<B>) => (fc: T.Task<C>) => (fd: T.Task<D>) => (
  fe: T.Task<E>
): T.Task<F> => pipe(fb, T.map(f), T.ap(fc), T.ap(fd), T.ap(fe))

// etc...
```

Now we cam update ore "composition table":

| Program f | Program g     | Composition     |
| --------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| pure      | pure          | `g ∘ f`         |
| effectful | pure (unary)  | `map(g) ∘ f`    |
| effectful | pure, `n`-ary | `liftAn(g) ∘ f` |

## The `of` operation

Now we know that given two function `f: (a: A) => F<B>`, `g: (b: B, c: C) => D` we can obtain the composition `h`:

```ts
h: (a: A) => (fc: F<C>) => F<D>
```

To execute `h` we need a new value of type `A` and a value of type `F<C>`.

But what happens if, instead of having a value of type `F<C>`, for the second parameter `fc` we only have a value of type `C`?

It would be helpful to have an operation which can transform a value of type `C` in a value of type `F<C>` in order to use `h`.

Let's introduce such operation, called `of` (other synonyms: **pure**, **return**):

```ts
declare const of: <C>(c: C) => F<C>
```

In literature the term **applicative functors** is used for the type constructors which admith _both_ the `ap` and `of` operations.

Let's see how `of` is defined for some type constructors we've already seen:

**Example** (`F = ReadonlyArray`)

```ts
const of = <A>(a: A): ReadonlyArray<A> => [a]
```

**Example** (`F = Option`)

```ts
import * as O from 'fp-ts/Option'

const of = <A>(a: A): O.Option<A> => O.some(a)
```

**Example** (`F = IO`)

```ts
import { IO } from 'fp-ts/IO'

const of = <A>(a: A): IO<A> => () => a
```

**Example** (`F = Task`)

```ts
import { Task } from 'fp-ts/Task'

const of = <A>(a: A): Task<A> => () => Promise.resolve(a)
```

**Example** (`F = Reader`)

```ts
import { Reader } from 'fp-ts/Reader'

const of = <R, A>(a: A): Reader<R, A> => () => a
```

**Demo**

[`05_applicative.ts`](src/05_applicative.ts)

## Applicative functors compose

Applicative functors compose, meaning that given two applicative functors `F` and `G`, their composition `F<G<A>>` is still an applicative functor.

**Example** (`F = Task`, `G = Option`)

The `of` of the composition is the composition of the `of`s:

```ts
import { flow } from 'fp-ts/function'
import * as O from 'fp-ts/Option'
import * as T from 'fp-ts/Task'

type TaskOption<A> = T.Task<O.Option<A>>

const of: <A>(a: A) => TaskOption<A> = flow(O.of, T.of)
```

the `ap` of the composition is obtained by the following pattern:

```ts
const ap = <A>(
  fa: TaskOption<A>
): (<B>(fab: TaskOption<(a: A) => B>) => TaskOption<B>) =>
  flow(
    T.map((gab) => (ga: O.Option<A>) => O.ap(ga)(gab)),
    T.ap(fa)
  )
```

## Do applicative functors solve the general problem?

Not yet. There's one last very important case to consider: when **both** programs are effectful.

Yet again we need something more, in the following chapter we'll talk about one of the most important abstractions in functional programming: **monads**.
